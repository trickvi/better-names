# Origin story

This project came to be when I saw a really badly implemented [*Icelandic name generator*](http://www.vg.no/spesial/2016/islandsk-navnegenerator/?lang=en) which swapped out characters just because, added random suffixes and didn't use genitive form. It was horrible to use as an Icelander but it was a nice idea. So I just wanted to do a better job of generating correct and thus **better names** (hence the name of the project).

So in an evening hacking session I threw this together. Sorry for sloppy code. I just wanted to get this out of my system.
